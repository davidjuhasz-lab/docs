# Creating an Application

Creating a new application is the first step toward building AI-powered assistants for your specific business needs. An application is a workspace that contains your agents, documents, and conversations organized around a specific purpose.

## User Story: Creating a Customer Support Application

**Scenario**: You're building a customer support system for an online electronics store. You need an application that will house a support agent capable of answering product questions, handling returns, and providing troubleshooting help based on your product documentation.

**Goal**: Create a new application called "Electronics Store Support" that will serve as the workspace for customer service AI agents.

### Step 1: Navigate to Applications

**Action**: From the Peak RAG admin dashboard home page, locate the navigation menu on the left side.

**What to do**: Click on the "Applications" menu item. This opens the applications management page showing all existing applications.

**What you'll see**: A list view of applications (may be empty if this is your first one) with a prominent "Create New Application" or "+ New Application" button.

### Step 2: Start Creating New Application

**Action**: Click the "Create New Application" button (usually located in the top-right corner of the applications page).

**What happens**: A creation form appears, either as a new page or a modal dialog, with several fields to fill out.

### Step 3: Set the Application Identifier

**Field**: Application ID (or Application Identifier)

**What to enter**: `electronics-store-support`

**Why this value**:

- Use lowercase letters only
- Separate words with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Keep it descriptive but concise
- This ID will be used in API calls and URLs
- Cannot be changed after creation

**Rules**:

- Must be unique across your organization
- No spaces or special characters except hyphens
- Typically 2-5 words maximum

### Step 4: Set the Display Name

**Field**: Display Name (or Name)

**What to enter**: `Electronics Store Support`

**Why this value**:

- This is the human-readable name shown throughout the admin interface
- Use proper capitalization and spacing
- Should clearly identify the application's purpose
- Can be changed later if needed

### Step 5: Add a Description

**Field**: Description (usually optional)

**What to enter**: `Customer support application for electronics store. Handles product inquiries, return requests, troubleshooting, and order status questions. Knowledge base includes product manuals, warranty information, and return policies.`

**Why this value**:

- Helps team members understand the application's purpose
- Documents the intended scope
- Useful reference when you have multiple applications
- Can include notes about what types of agents or documents belong here

### Step 6: Configure Document Collection

**Field**: Document Collection Name (or Knowledge Base Collection)

**What to enter**: `electronics_support_docs`

**Why this value**:

- Required if your agents will search through uploaded documents
- Use underscores for collection names (database convention)
- Keep it related to the application ID for easy identification
- This creates a Weaviate vector database collection

**When to skip this**: Only leave empty if you're building an application that uses exclusively document processing agents (OCR, validation) that don't need to search a knowledge base.

**Important**: Collection names cannot be changed after creation without data migration. Choose carefully.

### Step 7: Review Settings

**Action**: Before clicking Create, review all entered information:

- [x] Application ID: `electronics-store-support`
- [x] Display Name: `Electronics Store Support`
- [x] Description: Entered and descriptive
- [x] Document Collection: `electronics_support_docs`

**Check**: Make sure there are no typos in the Application ID since it cannot be changed.

### Step 8: Create the Application

**Action**: Click the "Create" or "Create Application" button (usually at the bottom or top-right of the form).

**What happens immediately**:

1. Form validates all fields
2. System checks that the Application ID is unique
3. If validation passes, the application is created
4. You're redirected to the new application's dashboard

**Behind the scenes**:

- Secure API secret is generated for authentication
- Document collection infrastructure is provisioned in Weaviate
- Application database records are created
- Default permissions are established

### Step 9: Verify Creation

**What you'll see**: The application dashboard page with several sections:

- **Overview tab**: Shows application summary and statistics (currently empty)
- **Agents tab**: Empty list with "Create New Agent" button
- **Documents tab**: Empty list with "Upload Documents" button
- **Threads/Conversations tab**: No conversations yet
- **Metrics tab**: No data yet

**Top of page shows**:

- Application Display Name: "Electronics Store Support"
- Application ID: `electronics-store-support`
- Status indicator: Active (green)

### Step 10: Copy API Credentials (Important)

**Action**: Look for an "API Credentials" or "Settings" section/button.

**What to find**:

- **Application ID**: `electronics-store-support` (you'll need this for API calls)
- **API Secret**: Long alphanumeric string (click to reveal/copy)

**What to do**:

1. Click the "Show" or eye icon next to API Secret
2. Click "Copy" to copy the secret to clipboard
3. Store this securely in your password manager or secure notes

**Why this matters**:

- You'll need these credentials to integrate the application with websites
- The API secret is shown only once at creation (you can regenerate it but existing integrations will break)
- Anyone with these credentials can access your application

**Note**: Access management is handled at the platform level by administrators. Only users with admin privileges can create and manage applications.

## Alternative User Story: Document Processing Application

**Scenario**: You're creating an application solely for processing loan application documents - no conversational agent needed.

**Different settings**:

**Field: Application ID**: `loan-document-processor`
**Field: Display Name**: `Loan Document Processor`
**Field: Description**: `Automated document validation for loan applications. Processes identity documents, income proofs, and application forms. No knowledge base needed.`
**Field: Document Collection Name**: _Leave empty_ - not needed since you're not building a conversational agent that searches documents

**Why leave collection empty**: Document processing agents (OCR, validation, type recognition) work directly on uploaded files. They don't need to search through a knowledge base, so no vector database collection is required.

## After Creation: Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Available

1. **Create Your First Agent**

   - Click "Agents" tab
   - Click "Create New Agent" button
   - Choose agent type based on your needs (see Creating Agents documentation)

2. **Upload Documents** (if you created a collection)

   - Click "Documents" tab
   - Click "Upload Documents" button
   - Select files from your computer
   - Documents will be processed and added to the knowledge base

3. **Review Application Settings**
   - Click the Settings or gear icon
   - Review default configurations
   - Adjust any settings specific to your use case

### Settings You Can Modify Later

**Changeable**:

- Display Name
- Description
- User permissions
- API Secret (can be regenerated if compromised)

**Not changeable**:

- Application ID
- Document Collection Name (requires data migration)

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Application ID already exists"**

- Solution: Choose a different, unique ID
- Try adding your company name or department: `acme-electronics-support`

**Error: "Invalid collection name"**

- Solution: Use only letters, numbers, and underscores
- No spaces, hyphens, or special characters in collection names

**Can't find the created application**

- Check: Make sure you're not filtered to show only archived applications
- Check: Verify you have permission to view the application
- Action: Use the search box to search by name

**API Secret not showing**

- Solution: Navigate to Settings > API Credentials
- Action: Click "Regenerate Secret" if you lost the original
- Warning: Regenerating breaks existing integrations until updated
