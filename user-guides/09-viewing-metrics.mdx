## Part 1: The Four Key Metric Cards

The dashboard displays four main metric cards, each with an icon, a primary metric, a subtitle, and a trend indicator comparing performance to the previous period.

| Icon             | Title                  | Subtitle                   | Purpose                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MessagesSquare` | **Thread Count**       | `avg. X messages/thread`   | Understanding the overall volume of user engagement.                          |
| `Timer`          | **Completion Latency** | `avg. completion latency`  | Monitoring agent response speed. A downward trend is positive.                |
| `Users`          | **Daily Active Users** | `avg. daily active users`  | Tracking user adoption and growth.                                            |
| `FileText`       | **Document Count**     | `X pages • Last update: Y` | Summarizing the size of the knowledge base. This card has no trend indicator. |

## Part 2: The Usage Chart

To the right of the metric cards is a card titled **Usage**, which contains a visual breakdown of agent activity.

- **Icon**: The card is headed by a `DollarSign` icon and the title "Usage".
- **Agent Filter**: A multi-select dropdown with the placeholder "**Select agents**" allows you to choose which agents to display on the chart.
- **Legend**: Below the filter, a color-coded legend identifies the selected agents.
- **Chart**: A stacked bar chart shows the total number of interactions for each day of the week, with segments in each bar representing a different agent.
- **X-Axis**: Labeled with the days of the week (e.g., `Mon`, `Tue`).
