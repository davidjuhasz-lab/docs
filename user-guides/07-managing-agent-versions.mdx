# 07 - Safely Updating and Iterating on Agents

This guide explains the recommended workflow for safely making and testing changes to your agents.

## Testing Agent Changes

The platform allows you to test agent modifications directly before deploying them to production.

### Step 1: Edit Your Agent

1.  **Navigate to the Agents Page**: From your application dashboard, go to the **Agents** page.
2.  **Edit the Agent**: Find the agent you want to modify (e.g., "TechGadgets Support Bot") and click its **"Edit"** button.
3.  **Make Your Changes**: Update the configuration values (e.g., **System Prompt**, tools, model settings).

### Step 2: Test Your Changes

1.  **Save**: Click **"Save"** to apply your changes to the agent.
2.  **Test**: Go to the **Test** tab for your agent and thoroughly test the new behavior.
3.  **Iterate**: If needed, continue editing and testing until you're satisfied with the results.

## Rolling Back Changes

If you need to revert changes, you can edit the agent again and restore the previous configuration. For critical production agents, consider keeping documentation of your previous settings before making changes.
