# 11 - Quiz Mode Setup

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the UI for configuring **Quiz Mode**, a feature for turning an assistant agent into an interactive learning tool.

### Implementation Status

**Note**: The admin panel provides the UI for configuring Quiz Mode, but it does not include an interactive quiz runtime. This setup is intended for use in custom workflows.

## Part 1: Enabling Quiz Mode

Quiz Mode is an optional feature for `assistant` agents.

1.  **Open the Agent Modal**: Create a new agent or edit an existing one.
2.  **Navigate to Specifications**: In the modal, proceed to the **"Specifications"** section.
3.  **Enable the Feature**: Find and turn on the **"Quiz Mode Enabled"** switch.

Once enabled, a **"Quiz"** tab will appear in the modal's navigation, containing all the settings for this feature.

## Part 2: Quiz Mode Configuration

All settings are found in the **"Quiz"** section of the agent configuration modal.
