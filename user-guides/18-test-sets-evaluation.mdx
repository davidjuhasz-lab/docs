# 18 - Test Sets and Evaluation

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the UI for creating, running, and evaluating automated agent test sets.

---

## Part 1: Creating a Test Set

(This process is covered in detail in the "Testing Your Agents" guide. This guide focuses on the evaluation of results.)

---

## Part 2: Evaluating Test Results

The **"History"** tab on the **Agents** page lists all previous test runs.

### Test Run Summary Row

Each test run is displayed in a summary row that shows:

- The **Test Set Name**.
- **Agent Tested**: An icon and the agent's display name.
- **Question Count**: An icon and the number of questions in the test set.
- **Last Run**: A timestamp of when the test was executed. For tests in progress, this shows a spinner and "In progress".
- **Acceptance Rate**: A percentage with a color-coded `CircleCheckBig` (pass) or `CircleX` (fail) icon.
- **Export Button**: An `ArrowUpFromLine` icon to export the results.
- **Delete Button**: A `Trash` icon to delete the test run.

### Expanded Test Run View

- **Action**: Click on a test run row to expand it.
- **Result**: The view expands to show a detailed breakdown of each question.

#### Filtering and Actions

- **Filter**: A dropdown to filter questions by `Show All`, `Accepted`, or `Rejected`.
- **Search**: A search bar to find specific questions.
- **Select all**: A button to select all questions in the current view.
- **Rerun selected**: A button to re-run only the selected questions.

#### Question-by-Question Results

Each question is displayed in a card with its own expand button (`ChevronDown`).

- **Collapsed View**: Shows the question and a radio button for selection.
- **Expanded View**: Shows:
  - The **Question**.
  - The **Expected Answer**.
  - The **Actual Answer** from the agent.
  - The **Retrieved Contexts** used by the agent.
  - A **Metrics** table with automated scores for `context_precision`, `faithfulness`, `answer_relevancy`, etc., each with a color-coded score.
