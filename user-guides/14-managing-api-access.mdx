# 14 - Managing API Access

This guide provides a high-level overview for developers on how to interact with the Peak RAG platform programmatically.

---

### **Important**: No-UI Feature

There is **no user interface** in the admin dashboard for managing API access. All the concepts described here are for developers building custom integrations.

---

## Part 1: Purpose of the API

The API allows you to integrate Peak RAG's powerful agent and conversation features directly into your own applications, services, and workflows.

**Common use cases include:**

- Building a fully custom chatbot interface for your website or mobile app.
- Integrating an agent into a backend process (e.g., automatically analyzing a support ticket with a document agent).
- Creating automated scripts for testing or data analysis.

## Part 2: Authentication

To ensure security, all API requests must be authenticated. The authentication method depends on your integration type:

### For User-Facing Applications

- **Mechanism**: The API is protected by **OAuth 2.0**, which is the industry standard for secure authorization.
- **Implementation**: Your application must request a temporary **Bearer Token** from your organization's Identity Provider (e.g., Keycloak or Azure Entra ID).
- **Usage**: This token must be sent with every API request in the `Authorization` header.

Developers should refer to the technical documentation in the **Knowledge Base (`Integration / API Access`)** and their Identity Provider's documentation for detailed instructions on how to implement an OAuth 2.0 flow.

### For Server-to-Server Integrations

- **Static API Keys**: For backend server integrations, the platform supports **static API keys** that can be used directly without OAuth 2.0 flows.
- **Security**: These keys should only be used in server-side code and never exposed in client-side applications or public repositories.
- **Access**: Static API keys are generated during application creation and can be found in the application settings.

## Part 3: General API Flow

While the specific endpoints are detailed in the Knowledge Base, the general process for having a conversation with an agent via the API is as follows:

1.  **Obtain an Authentication Token** from your Identity Provider.
2.  **Create a Conversation Thread**: Make an initial API call to create a new conversation thread for a specific agent. The API will respond with a unique `threadId`.
3.  **Send a Message**: Make another API call to send the user's message, including the `threadId` in the request header to specify which conversation it belongs to.
4.  **Receive a Streamed Response**: The API will stream the agent's response back in real-time, allowing for a "typing" effect in your custom application.
5.  **Continue the Conversation**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each subsequent message in the conversation, always using the same `threadId`.

This workflow allows for persistent, stateful conversations, just like in the web widget.
