# Core Concepts

The Peak RAG platform is built around a few fundamental entities. Understanding their roles and relationships is key to designing and implementing effective AI solutions.

## 1. Application

An **Application** is the top-level container for a specific AI use case or project. It acts as a security and data boundary, isolating all a project's resources.

- **Technical Role**: An Application serves as a logical workspace. All resources, including agents, documents, and user access, are scoped to a single application. This multi-tenant design ensures data cannot leak between different projects or departments.
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `applicationId`: A unique identifier generated from the application name.
  - **Document Collection**: Each application has a dedicated vector collection in Weaviate, serving as its private knowledge base.
  - **User Access**: Users are granted access on a per-application basis.

## 2. Agent

An **Agent** is a specialized AI entity designed to perform a specific task. It combines an LLM with a configuration, a specific prompt, and a set of tools to execute its function.

- **Technical Role**: An agent is the primary execution unit. When a request is made, the system routes it to a specific agent, which then orchestrates the RAG pipeline, tool usage, and final response generation.
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `agentId`: A unique identifier, used to invoke the agent via API or SDK.
  - **Schema**: The agent's type, which defines its core behavior and available configuration options (e.g., `assistant`, `document-evaluation`). This is a critical architectural constraint that determines which backend services and logic are used.
  - **System Prompt**: The master instruction set that defines the agent's personality, goals, and constraints.
  - **LLM Configuration**: The specific language model, temperature, and other parameters the agent will use.
  - **Tool Configuration**: The set of tools (e.g., Knowledge Retrieval, Web Search) the agent is allowed to use.

## 3. Document & Vector Collection

A **Document** represents a single piece of information uploaded to the system (e.g., a PDF, TXT, or DOCX file). The **Vector Collection** is the indexed, machine-readable representation of all documents in an application.

- **Technical Role**: Documents are the raw source material. During ingestion, they are passed through a pipeline that chunks them into smaller segments. Each chunk is then converted into a numerical vector (an embedding) by an embedding model. These vectors are stored in a Weaviate vector collection.
- **Process Flow**:
  1.  **Ingestion**: A document is uploaded.
  2.  **Chunking**: The document is split into smaller, semantically coherent text chunks.
  3.  **Embedding**: Each chunk is passed through an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`) to create a vector.
  4.  **Indexing**: The vector and its corresponding text chunk are stored in the application's dedicated vector collection for efficient similarity search.

This collection forms the "Retrieval" part of RAG, allowing agents to find relevant information to augment their responses.

## 4. Thread

A **Thread** is a persistent record of a conversation between a user and an agent.

- **Technical Role**: A thread maintains the state of an interaction, including the full message history. When a user sends a new message in an existing thread, the history is passed to the agent, providing crucial context for generating a coherent, multi-turn response.
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `threadId`: A unique identifier for the conversation.
  - **Message History**: A chronological log of user queries and agent responses.
  - **User and Agent Association**: Links the thread to the specific user and agent involved.
