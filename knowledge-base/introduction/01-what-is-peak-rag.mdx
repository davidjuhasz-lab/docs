# What is Peak RAG?

Peak RAG is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade platform for building and deploying sophisticated AI applications powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It provides a complete ecosystem for creating specialized AI agents that can reason over private data, process complex documents, and automate intelligent workflows.

Unlike general-purpose AI assistants, Peak RAG is designed to ground AI responses in your specific, proprietary data, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and control over the information being delivered.

## Core Architecture

The platform is architected around three fundamental principles:

1.  **Data-Grounded Intelligence**: At its core, Peak RAG connects Large Language Models (LLMs) to your private knowledge bases. This is achieved through a robust RAG pipeline that includes document ingestion, chunking, vectorization, and advanced retrieval strategies. This ensures that agents provide answers based on your data, not on the LLM's generalized training set, which mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy.

2.  **Modular and Specialized Agents**: Instead of a single, monolithic AI, Peak RAG uses a multi-agent architecture. You can build, configure, and deploy various types of agents, each with a specific "schema" or purpose—from conversational assistants and document processors to educational tools. This modularity allows you to create highly specialized, efficient, and manageable AI solutions for different business needs.

3.  **Developer-Extensible Framework**: While offering a user-friendly interface for no-code configuration, the platform is built on a scalable and extensible backend. It uses technologies like NestJS, Prisma, and Weaviate to provide a solid foundation for custom integrations, new agent types, and complex workflow orchestration.

## Key Use Cases

- **Intelligent Customer Support**: Build AI assistants that provide instant, accurate answers to customer queries based on your product documentation, support articles, and internal wikis.
- **Automated Document Processing**: Deploy agents that can read, understand, validate, and extract structured data from unstructured documents like invoices, contracts, and application forms.
- **Internal Knowledge Management**: Create internal-facing assistants that help employees quickly find information from company policies, technical documentation, and project archives.
- **Personalized Education**: Develop educational agents that generate tailored learning paths, syllabi, and quizzes based on a curriculum of educational materials.

By combining a powerful RAG implementation with a flexible multi-agent system, Peak RAG provides the tools to move beyond simple chatbots and build truly intelligent, data-driven applications.
