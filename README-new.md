# Peak RAG Documentation

Welcome to the complete documentation for the Peak RAG platform. This repository provides two distinct sets of documentation to help you master the application:

1.  **User Guides**: Practical, step-by-step instructions focused on the "how." These guides walk you through every feature of the user interface, explaining how to perform specific tasks.
2.  **Knowledge Base**: Conceptual explanations focused on the "why" and "what." This section details the technology, architecture, and AI concepts that power the platform.
